# Encryption
Chatbots are continuing to offer businesses and consumers big benefits, and WhatsApp Bots are doing the same. The great news is that creating a WhatsApp bot is simple when you put best practices in place. But it’s important to gain a solid understanding of what a WhatsApp Bot is, how to make one and why you’ll need it. A WhatsApp Bot is a chatbot or software program you can use specifically on the popular encrypted messaging app WhatsApp. A WhatsApp Bot enables you to embark on conversational commerce. But there may also be a flaw in using a whats app bot for my project, because the main aim of this project is to send an encrypted secret message.I am going to use Gecko driver which is supported by Mozilla Firefox and send the encrypted messages. For adaptability this project can even work with Selenium which supports Google chrome.
